# 📬 Email-Folder AI Agent Hackathon

Welcome to the **Email-Folder AI Agent Hackathon**! 🎉 In this challenge, you’ll build an intelligent agent that:

1. Reads customer emails from a designated folder  
2. Parses sender, subject, body text, and attachments (mostly PDFs)  
3. Invokes a document‐extraction API or model to pull structured content  
4. Generates a concise summary of both email context and extracted document details  
5. (Optional) Presents the summary on a lightweight web front‐end for user confirmation  

---

## 🏆 Challenge Overview

Many businesses receive dozens—or even hundreds—of emails per day, each potentially containing valuable documents. Your goal is to automate this pipeline end to end:

1. **Ingest**: Load raw `.eml` or `.msg` files from a given folder  
2. **Parse**: Extract metadata (sender, subject), body text, and attachments  
3. **Extract**: Feed attachments into a document‐extraction API or your own model to obtain structured data  
4. **Summarize & Confirm**: Produce a human‐readable summary (JSON or HTML) of email + document contents, ready for user confirmation via a simple web UI  
5. **Deliver**: Package your solution into a GitHub repo, complete with a flowchart and clear run instructions

## 🎯 What We’re Looking For

- **Correctness & Coverage**  
  - All emails in the folder are processed reliably  
  - Attachments (PDFs, DOCX, images) are parsed and extracted  
  - Summaries include both email metadata and document content details  

- **Architecture Clarity**  
  - A clear flowchart (PNG, SVG, or Mermaid in Markdown) illustrating each stage  
  - Well‐structured README with step‐by‐step setup/run guide  

- **Code Quality & Modularity**  
  - Clean, maintainable code (Python, Node.js, Java, etc.)  
  - Robust error handling (missing fields, corrupt files, network issues)  

- **Ease of Deployment**  
  - Simple local setup instructions (`pip install`, `npm install`)  
  - Bonus: Dockerfile or `docker-compose.yml`  

- **Innovation & UX**  
  - Bonus for a lightweight web front‐end (React/Flask/Express) for manual confirmation/editing of extracted data

## 🗂️ Dataset

A ZIP archive containing sample emails (included in this repo under `/emails`):

- `emails/sample1.eml`  
- `emails/sample2.eml`  
- …  

Each may include zero or more attachments (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.jpeg`).

> **Tip:** You can generate your own test emails or leverage open‐source libraries like [mailparser](https://github.com/mscdex/mailparser) or [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) for parsing.
